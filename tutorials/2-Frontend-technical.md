Following steps to init a frontend application

## Firebase project

Create new Firebase project

## Gatsby

Init GatsbyJS with the command `npm init gatsby`. Please note that this command **required empty folder**. So current if you have an existing folder, just do another one and copy everything after finish.

Some very essential gatsby plugins are:
- `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`
- `gatsby-plugin-image`
- `gatsby-plugin-manifest`
- `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`
- `gatsby-plugin-sharp`
- `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`
- `gatsby-transformer-sharp`

Nice to have also:
- `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`

About the styling solution, I chose `styled-components` but you can choose whatever.
