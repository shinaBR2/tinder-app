# Architecture

Next step of defining data structure is talking about architecture. For the most web application now, I propose [3factor architecture](https://3factor.app/). Detail explaination and technical related issues, I will show later then.

We should talk about frontend first

# Technical solutions

Here are list of libraries and frameworks I use:
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a static site generator, built on top of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication, analytics and so on.
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for styling solution.

For the backend stuffs, just use only [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is enough.

Anything else should be updated later.
